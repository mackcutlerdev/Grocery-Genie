# GroceryGenie

GroceryGenie’s goal is an app that tracks items in your pantry at home, manage your recipes, and have a “What can I make?” matching system for people who don’t have time or don’t want to spend time trying to figure out what to cook at the end of a long day.

## How to start

Open a new terminal and make sure you are in the root directory,
Then do `cd server` to go into the server directory,
Then type in `npm run dev` which will start the server and the client,
Which should have you ready to go.
